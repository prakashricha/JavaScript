Wrote code that created a table dynamically based upon a [dataset provided](StarterCode/static/js/data.js). That also allowed our users to filter the table data for specific values. Used  JavaScript, HTML, and CSS, and D3.js  web pages. 


### Automatic Table and Date Search

* Created a basic HTML web page with (StarterCode/index.html) 

* Using the UFO dataset provided in the form of an array of JavaScript objects, wrote code that appends a table to your web page and then adds new rows of data for each UFO sighting. created column for `date/time`, `city`, `state`, `country`, `shape`, and `comment` .

* Used a date form in your HTML document and wrote JavaScript code that will listen for events and search through the `date/time` column to find rows that match user input.

### Multiple Search Categories 

* Using multiple `input` tags and/or select dropdowns, wrote JavaScript code so the user can to set multiple filters and search for UFO sightings using the following criteria based on the table columns:

  1. `date/time`
  2. `city`
  3. `state`
  4. `country`
  5. `shape`
